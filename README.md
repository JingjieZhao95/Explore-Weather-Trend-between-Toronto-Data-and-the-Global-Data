# Explore-Weather-Trend-between-Toronto-and-the-Global-Data

## Introduction
In this project, I will analyze local(Toronto) and global temperature data and compare the temperature trends where i live to overall global temperature trends.

## Instruction
My goal is to create a visualization and prepare a write up describing the similarities and differences between global temperature trends and temperature trends in Toronto.To do this, i’ll follow the steps below:
* Extract the data from the database
* Open up the CSV in Excel
* Create a line chart that compares Toronto’s temperatures with the global temperatures
* Make observations about the similarities and differences between the world averages and Toronto’s averages, as well as overall trends

## Make observations (similarities and differences)
The graph illustrates the moving average for both Toronto and global temperatures between 1750 and 2013. 

1. The temperature in Toronto has been two to three degrees Celsius lower than the global temperature for the entire period of time. 
2. They both experienced a rapid decline around 1806 and reached a trough in 1820, followed by the temperature rise and back to the average level around 1834. 
3. The upward trend of the global temperature is more stable, while the Toronto temperature got through several fluctuated stages after 1876.
