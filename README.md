# Explore-Weather-Trend-between-Toronto-and-the-Global-Data

## Introduction
In this project, I will analyze local(Toronto) and global temperature data and compare the temperature trends where i live to overall global temperature trends.

## Instruction
My goal is to create a visualization and prepare a write up describing the similarities and differences between global temperature trends and temperature trends in Toronto.To do this, i’ll follow the steps below:
* Extract the data from the database
* Open up the CSV in Excel
* Create a line chart that compares Toronto’s temperatures with the global temperatures
* Make observations about the similarities and differences between the world averages and Toronto’s averages, as well as overall trends
